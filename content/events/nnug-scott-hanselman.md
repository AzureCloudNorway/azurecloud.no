Hey friends!

What is the meaning of life?
Should you pour milk before cereal or cereal before milk?
Can you really use Windows to develop Linux apps?

These are some of life's biggest questions. We cannot guarantee an answer to the first two questions but luckily for us we have Scott Hanselman who will enlighten us on Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) and its capabilities.

This will be a demo filled session where Scott will take us through the state of art of Linux on Windows. What is possible to do, what is not, how can you use the Windows Terminal and Docker and much more.
